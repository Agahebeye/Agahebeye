### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gahebeye Aboubakar :man:. I'm a software engineering graduate :mortar_board: who enjoys building stuff with code.

Back in 2015, When I was in the last year of my high school I was introduced to Programming that immediately won my heart and made me to pursue my dreams in software engineering in college. I then created a bunch of programs in Pascal before I started to learn C++. 

I remember creating a calculator and a timer in C++ which impressed my friends and got them believe I was a genius.

Since 2018, I have decided to learn web development and over the years I've been building web projects to improve my skills and helped my friends learn web technologies.

I am open for a web developer role to help a company with my skills to achieve their goals
