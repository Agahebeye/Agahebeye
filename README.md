### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gahebeye Aboubakar. I'm a software engineer graduate and fullstack web developer.

When I was in the last year of my high school I was introduced to Pascal, the first language to ever learn, I immediately fell in love with programming and decided to pursue my dreams in software engineering in college
